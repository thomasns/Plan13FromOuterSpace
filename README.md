# Plan 13 From Outer Space


This is my attempt at implementing [James Miller's Plan 13](https://www.amsat.org/articles/g3ruh/111.html) satellite tracking program as a Java webapp using the Spring Framework. 

## Goals
- Track when ham radio related satellites will be visible from a particular location.
- Estimate when a satellite will be accessible from two locations.
- Preset up-to-date radio settings for satellites (uplink/downlink frequencies, PL Tones, etc)

## Current Status
Work is just beginning and so far I've just added a few basic entities.
